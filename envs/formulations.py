"""Training formulations for the PCB placement+routing problem — encoded so you can
pick one when you train (heavy RL is GPU/later). See docs/formulations.md for the full
write-up and the election rationale.

The router itself is classical (negotiated octilinear/rectilinear A* + auto layer
assignment). Learning can be injected at different decision points; each is an MDP in
FORMULATIONS below. This module also provides the SHARED terminal reward and a CPU
evaluator for the elected formulation, so a policy (or a heuristic) can be scored
without any training loop.

# placement measurably reaches single-layer routing on boards with room + gaps
# (gap-aligned: 16/16, 18/18, 19/20 on 120mm/3-gap vs ring's 15-17, 0-1 vias). Train it
# first. For the hard residual — tight or few-gap boards, where no placement beats the
# topology — the deeper lever is ordered_layer (F4): control routing order + layer
# directly to minimize the layer/via count.
